A few interesting things about me. I love to learn new technologies. Learning new things keeps me motivated. I like to play video games. Everyday i try to be a better person than i was yersterday and learn from my previous mistakes.

Currently, i am working as a Junior Deep learning Engineer at CPSD Technologes Ltd.
I am been researching on making efficient AI systems that are not hungry to eat up ram and is not as slow as a tortoise. Thus, I have been experimenting with SOTA techniques like model pruning , quantization to make the inference time of the model faster. 

Beside that, i have been researching on speaker recognition. Our goal is to make a well generalized model, that can not only perform well on data from different distribution but also on inter-language dataset.
